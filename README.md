Sealed Class Analyzer is a Visual Studio extension designed to enhance code quality and performance by analyzing C# projects for classes that are not marked as sealed. 
It identifies such classes and provides warnings, encouraging developers to consider sealing classes to prevent unintended inheritance.

The extension includes a quick fix option, allowing you to automatically add the sealed modifier with a single action. 
Ideal for teams aiming to enforce best practices in object-oriented design, Sealed Class Analyzer seamlessly integrates into your workflow, improving maintainability and code security.
